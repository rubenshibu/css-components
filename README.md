Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
https://github.com/this-is-you/css-components.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the [css-components](https://github.com/rubenshibu/css-components) repository on GitHub to your computer.

Before cloning the repository you just make sure that you have changed the directory to _Desktop_ or to some other locations, To change the directory to Desktop run the following command:

```
cd Desktop
```

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd css-components
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-alan-mathew
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)
